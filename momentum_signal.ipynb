    "In a momentum trading signal there are one thing to focus on: the ATR (average true range). The concept is as follows:\n",
    "* Calculate the ATR (Average True Range) to measure volatility.\n",
    "* Identify a \"squeeze\" using the ATR: When the current ATR is lower than the 30-day average ATR (it signals a consolidation period or a squeeze)\n",
    "* Buy Signal: If Price breaks the Highest High of the last 20 days + 1 ATR, BUY.\n",
    "* Exit Signal: If Price falls below the Lowest Low of the last 10 days, SELL.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an ATR?\n",
    "* True Range (TR) looks at the greatest of three distances: Today's High to Today's Low, Yesterday's Close to Today's High, Yesterday's Close to Today's Low.\n",
    "    * The reason for this rather than just looking at the intraday highs and lows is to avoid missing out any overnight trading effects\n",
    "* ATR is simply the moving average (usually 14 days) of those True Range values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the squeeze\n",
    "$$ Current ATR<30-Day Average ATR $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the buy signal\n",
    "* The 20-Day High: This is a classic \"Donchian Channel\" breakout. If the price reaches a new 20-day high, it is a of a possible breakout\n",
    "* The \"+ 1 ATR\" (The Noise Filter): By requiring the price to break the high plus one full unit of average volatility (ATR), you are ensuring the move has real power behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the exit signal\n",
    "* The lowest low in the past 10 days, natural the periods set are variable due to \"Stock Personalities\""
