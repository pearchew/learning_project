    "This is the difference between a \"tutorial follower\" and a \"developer.\" To make this project get you hired in Hong Kong, you need to add **Friction** and **Complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three specific tiers of upgrades you can build on top of your current script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 1: The \"Realism\" Upgrade (Transaction Costs)\n",
    "**The Problem:** Your current script assumes trading is free. In reality, every trade costs money (commission + slippage). A strategy that makes 10% profit with 1,000 trades might actually lose money once you pay 0.1% per trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Task:**\n",
    "1.  Define a cost variable (e.g., `COST = 0.001` for 10bps).\n",
    "2.  Detect *when* a trade happens. A trade happens when the signal *changes* (e.g., from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0).\n",
    "3.  Subtract the cost from your returns on those specific days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code Add-On:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate when a trade occurs (Buy or Sell)\n",
    "# .diff() calculates the difference between row N and row N-1\n",
    "# If signal goes 0 -> 1, diff is 1. If 1 -> 0, diff is -1.\n",
    "# We take the absolute value because we pay fees on BOTH buying and selling.\n",
    "df['Trades'] = df['Signal'].diff().abs()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subtract costs from the strategy return\n",
    "# We shift the cost to occur on the day of execution (same as the return)\n",
    "# Note: We fillNA(0) because the first row can't differ from a previous row\n",
    "transaction_cost = 0.001  # 0.1% per trade\n",
    "df['Strategy_Net_Returns'] = df['Strategy_Returns'] - (df['Trades'].shift(1) * transaction_cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Re-calculate your cumulative wealth with the Net Returns\n",
    "df['Net_Equity'] = (1 + df['Strategy_Net_Returns']).cumprod()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 2: The \"Engineer\" Upgrade (Parameter Optimization)\n",
    "**The Problem:** Why did you pick 50 and 200 days? Because a blog told you to?\n",
    "A Quant tests *everything*. Maybe 40 and 180 is better for NVIDIA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Task:**\n",
    "Write a loop that tests every combination of \"Short Window\" (10 to 50) and \"Long Window\" (100 to 250) and tells you which pair had the highest Sharpe Ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code Structure:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "best_sharpe = 0\n",
    "best_params = (0, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nested loops to test combinations\n",
    "for short_window in range(20, 60, 5): # Test 20, 25, 30...\n",
    "    for long_window in range(150, 250, 10): # Test 150, 160...\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # 1. Calculate SMAs with these specific windows\n",
    "        # 2. Generate Signals\n",
    "        # 3. Calculate Sharpe\n",
    "        \n",
    "        if current_sharpe > best_sharpe:\n",
    "            best_sharpe = current_sharpe\n",
    "            best_params = (short_window, long_window)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Optimal Strategy: Buy at {best_params[0]} / {best_params[1]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Warning:* If you put this on your resume, be prepared to discuss \"Overfitting.\" (Just because 42/186 worked in the past doesn't mean it will work in the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier 3: The \"Product\" Upgrade (Interactive Dashboard)\n",
    "**The Problem:** A Jupyter Notebook is ugly. You can't send a notebook to a Recruiter.\n",
    "**The Fix:** Turn your script into a web app using **Streamlit**. It requires no HTML/CSS knowledge, just Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Task:**\n",
    "1.  Install streamlit (`pip install streamlit`).\n",
    "2.  Create a file `app.py`.\n",
    "3.  Add sliders so the user can change the moving averages themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code Snippet:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "st.title(\"HK Quant Backtester\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sidebar for user inputs\n",
    "ticker = st.sidebar.text_input(\"Ticker Symbol\", \"NVDA\")\n",
    "short_w = st.sidebar.slider(\"Short Window\", 10, 100, 50)\n",
    "long_w = st.sidebar.slider(\"Long Window\", 100, 300, 200)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... [Insert your Backtest Logic Here using these variables] ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display results\n",
    "st.line_chart(df[['Strategy_Equity', 'Buy_Hold_Equity']])\n",
    "st.write(f\"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**The ROI:** You can host this for free on \"Streamlit Cloud\" and put the link in your LinkedIn bio. \"Check out my algorithmic trading engine\" sounds much better than \"I know Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which one should you do first?\n",
    "Do **Tier 1 (Transaction Costs)** immediately. It shows you understand that trading isn't free. This is the #1 thing that separates academic projects from industry-ready code."
